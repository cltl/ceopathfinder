CEO CLASSES: DEFINITIONS, CLASS MAPPINGS, ASSERTIONS AND EXAMPLES OF THE INSTANTIATION OF THE ASSERTIONS.\
\
This file provides a human readable version of the Circumstantial Event Ontology 1.0.\
All classes are in alphabetical order. For each class we provide:\
	-the subclass relation;\
	-the class definition;\
	-the mappings from CEO classes to FrameNet and SUMO (as available online at January 27th, 2018);\
	-the assertions for each class defining the situation that holds before, after and/or during the event, including all the inherited assertions;\
	-examples that show what the CEO class assertions can and can not infer from a sentence annotated with FrameNet-based SRL.\
